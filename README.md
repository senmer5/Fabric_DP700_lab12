# üö¥‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Real-Time Data Analysis with Microsoft Fabric Eventhouse

## üéØ Project Purpose

The goal of this lab was to explore **Microsoft Fabric's Real-Time Intelligence capabilities** using an **eventhouse**. An eventhouse is used to ingest, store, and analyze streaming data in real time. In this hands-on exercise, I worked with a dataset about bike-sharing events and queried the data using both **Kusto Query Language (KQL)** and **Transact-SQL (T-SQL)** ‚Äì all through a **no-code interface**.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Steps Performed

### 1. Workspace Setup
- Created a new Microsoft Fabric workspace with Fabric capacity enabled.

### 2. Eventhouse Creation
- Opened the **Real-Time Intelligence Sample** under the **Real-Time Intelligence** workload.
- Automatically generated a new Eventhouse named `RTISample` with a preloaded **KQL database** and `Bikestream` table.

### 3. Querying Data with KQL
- Queried the `Bikestream` table using KQL.
- Displayed selected fields such as `Street` and `No_Bikes` with `project` operator.
- Renamed columns with user-friendly labels.
- Summarized total number of bikes using `summarize` and handled missing values using `case`, `isempty`, and `isnull`.
- Sorted results using both `sort by` and `order by`.
- Filtered data to specific neighbourhoods (e.g., `"Chelsea"`) using `where`.

### 4. Querying Data with T-SQL
- Used the T-SQL endpoint of the KQL database to run SQL-like queries.
- Retrieved data using `SELECT TOP`.
- Renamed fields using `AS`.
- Summarized bike counts grouped by `Neighbourhood`.
- Used `CASE` to handle null or empty values.
- Ordered and filtered the results using `ORDER BY` and `HAVING`.

### 5. Displayed Real-Time Metrics
- Displayed **total number of bikes per street** in a **5-second rolling window** using KQL queries.

### 6. Cleaned Up Resources
- Deleted the workspace to ensure no charges are incurred.

## üìò What I Learned

- How to **ingest and route streaming data** via Microsoft Fabric Eventstream.
- How to work with **KQL databases** inside an eventhouse.
- Used the **no-code interface** to perform real-time data transformation.
- Built and executed **KQL** queries for summarization, filtering, and sorting.
- Used **Transact-SQL** as an alternative query method.
- Completed a full real-time data pipeline **without writing backend code**.

## ‚úÖ Summary

This lab helped me gain hands-on experience in real-time data streaming with Microsoft Fabric. I was able to:
- Analyze live data streams,
- Use both KQL and T-SQL for querying,
- Perform data transformations through a visual interface.
